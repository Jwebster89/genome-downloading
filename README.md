quick script for creating a genome download script for NCBI

NCBI Assembly summary needs to be downloaded first from [here](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt).

Change the keyword in the download script to target the organisms you want E.g. "Xanthomonas" will find all complete level genomes from all of Xanthomonas.

These were quick scripts for personal usage. Please see my [NCBI genome downloading repository](https://github.com/Jwebster89/NCBI_genome_download) for a user friendly program for public use.
